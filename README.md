# Expanding SDO Capabilities

1) Using spatial information to calibrate the extreme UV (EUV) telescopes: EUV telescopes operating in space are known to degrade over the course of months to years. The rate of degradation is, a priori, unknown. Over the same time scales, the Sun's activity also changes. This project aims to use the spatial patterns of features on the Sun to arrive at a self-calibration of EUV instruments. This would avoid the need to calibrate against other sources.

2) The Solar Dynamics Observatory takes images of the Sun's corona as well as magnetic maps of its surface. The million degree corona exists because of the presence of certain spatial patterns of magnetic fields. In this project we aim to apply style/content transfer techniques to create virtual telescopes. If successful, future NASA missions would be more capable with less hardware. This would allow us to make better space weather forecasts.

We will use the data set described in Galvez et al. (2019, ApJS).
